# speak

This language is directly inspired by Linus Lee's work on his language [ink](https://www.github.com/thesephist/ink) and his talk from GopherCon [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALwmdcFiuGg&t=168s).

Examples on how its intended to look like can be found in the samples directory.

So far, it's experimental.
